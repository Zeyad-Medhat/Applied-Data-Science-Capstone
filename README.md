## **Overview**
SpaceX has revolutionized space exploration by reusing rockets, significantly reducing launch costs. The purpose of this project is to:
- Analyze SpaceX's historical launch data.
- Build predictive models to classify launch outcomes.
- Create an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

### **Goals**
- Understand launch site performance.
- Analyze payload and booster configurations' impact on launch success.
- Build machine learning models to predict rocket landing success.

---

## **Data Sources**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the SpaceX API and includes:
- Launch dates and sites.
- Payload details (mass, type, orbit).
- Booster configurations and versions.
- Launch success and rocket landing outcomes.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Launch Success by Site:** 
   - Kennedy Space Center (KSC LC-39A) has the highest success rate.
2. **Payload and Launch Success:**
   - Payloads between 3,000â€“5,000 kg have a higher success rate.
3. **Booster Performance:**
   - The Falcon 9 B5 booster version shows the highest reliability.
4. **Machine Learning Results:**
   - Predictive models achieved a 92% accuracy in classifying successful rocket landings.
5. **Dashboard Features:**
   - An interactive dashboard visualizes launch trends, success rates, and payload impacts.
